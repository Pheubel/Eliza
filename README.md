# ElizaBot
A small Discord bot backed by an ASP.Net Core web server providing a web interface for some simple interactions, such as reading commands and checking tags.

This project was made with blazor preview 5 to provide front-end functionality with the power of web assembly.

## Contributing
Anyone is free to contribute to this project. It is assumed that you follow C# naming conventions when writing code.
When setting up your own enviroment, it is adviced to run `git update-index --skip-worktree ElizaBot/Eliza/Server/appsettings.Development.json` in your git terminal to avoid accidentally committing sensitive data used for development.

### Note
I am not too familiar with graphical design, hence why the front-end design can be lackluster at times.
